//STEP 1
// Write a function called halfNumber() that accepts one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".



//STEP 2
// Write a function called squareNumber() that accepts one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."

//STEP 3
// Write a function called percentOf() that accepts two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."

//STEP 4
// Write a function called findModulus() that accepts two numbers. Within the function write a statement that returns the modulus of the first and second parameters. It should log a string like "2 is the modulus of 4 and 10."
